  "description": "When Dr. Henshaw awakens as a captive aboard what appears to be a Russian spacecraft hurtling toward Venus, his kidnapper offers an impossible bargain: surrender his secret process in exchange for safe return to Earth. Through a massive window, Henshaw witnesses stolen landmarks—the Eiffel Tower, the Woolworth Building—clutched by gravity-defying machines among the stars. But as a scientist, he knows that even the most elaborate deception leaves clues. In this classic tale of scientific deduction versus Cold War intrigue, one man's knowledge becomes his key to freedom.",
