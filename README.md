## About This Book

When Dr. Henshaw awakens as a captive aboard what appears to be a
Russian spacecraft hurtling toward Venus, his kidnapper offers an
impossible bargain: surrender his secret process in exchange for safe
return to Earth. Through a massive window, Henshaw witnesses stolen
landmarks—the Eiffel Tower, the Woolworth Building—clutched by
gravity-defying machines among the stars. But as a scientist, he knows
that even the most elaborate deception leaves clues. In this classic
tale of scientific deduction versus Cold War intrigue, one man's
knowledge becomes his key to freedom.
